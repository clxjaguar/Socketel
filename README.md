# Socketel
Portal to minitel webservices written in micropython for ESP32 microcontroller

# What is this ?
Officialy, Minitel services has been terminated in 2012. These robust temrinals were then only good to be added to our mountains of garbage.
But this was without some amazing guys who have put online their own minitel services !
The network is replaced with more modern solution (voip or websocket), but the services are the same as before.
Thanks to them, anyone with a working minitel terminal (which is not so rare in french house attic), can still taste the minitel experience..
